To build this project you have to define some environment variables:
 LIBTOOL - The libtool binary to use (usually libtool)
 PLATFORM - The platform to build for (linux for Linux, darwin for Mac OS X)
 DLLEXT - Extension of dynamic libraries (.so for Linux, .dylib for Mac OS X)
 JAVA_HOME - This is the path to the jdk to compile against
 SUNDIALS_HOME - $SUNDIALS_HOME/lib and $SUNDIALS_HOME/include should contain the appropriate libraries and headers for CVode
 BOOST_HOME - $BOOST_HOME/include should contain the headers of the boost library
See jni/make_linux.sh or jni/make_mac_osx.sh for examples.

To compile you run:
> mvn compile
> mvn -f pom_jni.xml compile
The libboostjni, libcvode and liblsodar libraries will recide in the jni/lib directory.

To manually compile the cvode, boost or lsodar wrappers, change into the jni directory and run
> make libcvode
> make libboostjni
> make liblsodar

To create a package you run:
> mvn package
